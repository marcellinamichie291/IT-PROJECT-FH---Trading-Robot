- Telegram bot:
      Here you can find the python code that run the Telegram Bot throuht the API and gives direction to other file like 'lt_strategy.py'
      The Telegram bot should be used as a demonstration of the already-passed perfomance the Bot could have done.
      The different API's keys should of stay private, that's why you'll not be able to find them in the code. We placed '#' instead.
